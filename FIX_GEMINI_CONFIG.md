# Fix: Gemini Configuration Issue

## Problem
The application was failing with a Pydantic validation error:
```
Fatal error: 1 validation error for Settings
gemini_api_key
  Extra inputs are not permitted
```

## Root Cause
The `.env` file contained a `GEMINI_API_KEY` that was added during incomplete Gemini integration work from the grid-zoom-implementation branch. The Settings model in `src/config/settings.py` does not have a `gemini_api_key` field, and Pydantic's strict mode rejects extra environment variables.

## Solution
1. Removed `GEMINI_API_KEY` from `.env` file
2. Removed leftover `src/models/__pycache__/gemini_client.cpython-312.pyc` file
3. No Gemini source code exists in the main branch, so complete removal was the cleanest approach

## Files Changed
- `.env` - Removed Gemini configuration section (not tracked in git)
- Deleted `src/models/__pycache__/gemini_client.cpython-312.pyc` (not tracked in git)

## Testing
Confirmed the application runs without errors:
- `python -m src.main --version` ✓
- `python -m src.main --plan test_scenarios/wikipedia_search_simple.txt --plan-only` ✓
