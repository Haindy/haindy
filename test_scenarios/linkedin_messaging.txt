LinkedIn Messaging POC (Desktop)

Goals:
- Operate in desktop mode using the already-open Firefox window signed into LinkedIn.
- See a users profile and send a message. 

Test actions:
1) Search for "Vanesa Iavarone" and open the profile. This user is already a contact. If there are multiple options choose the first.
2) Validate the profile shows the name and that a profile photo is present (no other profile checks).
3) Click the button to send a message.
4) Send a message saying "Portate bien!" exactly. Nothing more.
5) Verified the message is sent 

Notes:
- Keep the Firefox/LinkedIn window visible and frontmost; the agent will bring it forward via computer-use.
- Assume that all permissions are given for the test to succesfully run.
