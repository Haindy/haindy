Test Wikipedia Search

Go to https://www.wikipedia.org/

I want to make sure our users can search for topics on Wikipedia and find good information.

Please test:
- Search for "artificial intelligence" 
- Make sure the search works when you press Enter
- Verify you get to the AI article page
- Check that the article is complete with all the important sections (it should have history, applications, ethics, etc.) and that clicking on a section of the menu jumps to that section.
- Make sure there are images and useful information boxes
- The article should look professional and well-organized

This is important because Wikipedia is often the first place people go to learn about new topics.
