  "requirements": "Use the already-open Firefox window that is signed in to LinkedIn on the desktop. Do not launch a new browser or open new tabs. Steps:\n1) Bring the Firefox window with LinkedIn into focus and maximize it if needed.\n2) Search for candidate A and send a connection request with a short note.\n3) Search for candidate B (an existing connection) and send a brief message.\n4) Open candidate B's profile and generate a short sourcer-style summary of their experience.\nOperate entirely via desktop screenshots and absolute coordinates (no DOM). Prefer cached coordinates when available.",

    "Firefox/LinkedIn window is frontmost and ready for interaction",
    "Candidate A search completes and a connect invite is sent with a note",
    "Candidate B search completes and an in-network message is sent",
    "Candidate B profile is opened and summarized in the final output"
