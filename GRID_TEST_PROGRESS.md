# Grid System Test Progress & Results

## Test Results Summary

### Overall Statistics
- Total test cases completed: 5/7 (with OpenAI o4-mini)
- Average success rate: 86% (across all completed tests with OpenAI)
- Optimal reasoning effort: Medium
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Results**: 100% accuracy on Wikipedia debate link test (both coarse and fine grids)

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Wikipedia "debate" Link
- **Success Rate**: 100% (10 runs)
- **URL**: Wikipedia AI article
- **Target**: "debate" link in main article text
- **Coarse Grid**: B5 (100% consistent)
- **Fine Grid**: F2 (70%), E2 (30%)
- **Key Finding**: Excellent accuracy for inline text links

### 2. Google GDPR Accept Button
- **Success Rate**: 80-100% (depending on expected cells)
- **URL**: Google.com
- **Target**: Accept/Aceptar button on GDPR banner
- **Coarse Grid**: E6 (80%), E7 (20%), F6 (incorrect)
- **Fine Grid**: C8 (most common), C1 (when E7 selected)
- **E7 Issue**: When E7 is selected, fine grid picks C1 which is below button center
- **Recommendation**: Use only D6/E6 as expected coarse cells

### 3. GitHub Star Button
- **Success Rate**: 60% (5 runs)
- **URL**: github.com/microsoft/vscode
- **Target**: Star button in repository header
- **Coarse Grid**: G1 (60%), G2/F2 (40% - wrong row)
- **Fine Grid**: D7 (100% when G1 selected)
- **Challenge**: AI sometimes confuses row positioning
- **Improvement**: Added prompt instructions to avoid grouping nearby buttons

### 4. eBay Cart Icon
- **Success Rate**: 100% (5 runs)
- **URL**: ebay.com
- **Target**: Shopping cart icon in top nav
- **Coarse Grid**: G1 (100% consistent)
- **Fine Grid**: G2 (60%), G1 (20%), F1 (20%)
- **Key Success**: Excellent performance with small UI elements (4-cell span)

### 5. YouTube Play Button
- **Success Rate**: 90% (10 runs)
- **URL**: YouTube video (Rick Astley)
- **Target**: Play button in video control bar (bottom left)
- **Coarse Grid**: A6 (90%), F1 (10% - confused with cookie banner)
- **Fine Grid**: C3 (100% of successful runs)
- **Note**: Originally tested overlay play button (C4), then switched to control bar button

## Key Discoveries & Improvements

### 1. Reasoning Effort Optimization
- **Low**: 60% success (faster but less accurate)
- **Medium**: 80-100% success (optimal balance)
- **High**: 60% success (slower, no accuracy benefit)
- **Conclusion**: Medium reasoning effort is optimal

### 2. Prompt Engineering Evolution
- Initial prompt: 40% success rate
- Role-playing prompt: 60% success rate
- Centroid-focused prompt: 80% success rate
- Added instructions to avoid grouping nearby elements
- Added emphasis on geometric center vs text start position

### 3. Image Compression Implementation
- Converted from PNG to JPEG with 80% quality
- Results:
  - Coarse grid: 419KB → 247KB (41% reduction)
  - Base screenshot: 402KB → 201KB (50% reduction)
  - Fine grid: 97KB → 64KB (34% reduction)
- AI recognition maintained at 100% with compressed images

### 4. Technical Improvements
- Added reasoning_effort parameter to OpenAI client
- Implemented test parameterization for multiple UI elements
- Added expected cell validation for automated pass/fail
- Added fine grid image saving with run numbers for debugging
- Implemented AI self-debugging for failed attempts

## Gemini 2.5 Flash Integration Results

### Prompt Engineering Breakthrough
Successfully integrated Google Gemini 2.5 Flash as an alternative vision model with optimized prompts:

#### Winning Prompts for Gemini:
**Coarse Grid:**
```
What cell do I need to choose in the following screenshot if I were to place my mouse over the {element}?
Keep in mind that I want to hit the center of the element.
Please reply just with the cell.
```

**Fine Grid:**
```
Ok now look at these two images. They are both a 4x zoom of the {cell} cell you selected before. The first image is the clean screenshot without any grid overlay so you can see the actual content. The second image is the same screenshot but with a finer 8x8 grid overlay. Which cell in this new grid do I need to select to hit the center of the element?
Keep in mind that I want to hit the center of the element.
Please reply just with the cell you have chosen.
```

### Wikipedia Debate Link Results with Gemini:
- **Coarse Grid**: 100% accuracy (B5) - 10/10 runs
- **Fine Grid**: 100% accuracy (F3) - 10/10 runs  
- **Key Discovery**: Adding "Keep in mind that I want to hit the center of the element" eliminated all variation
- **Previous Issue**: Without the centering reminder, Gemini had 90% F3, 10% G3
- **Performance**: Achieved perfect results where o4-mini had only 70-90% accuracy

### Key Differences from OpenAI:
1. Gemini prefers simple, direct prompts over complex multi-paragraph instructions
2. The centering reminder is crucial for consistency
3. No system prompts needed (empty string)
4. Conversation context works well for fine grid stage
5. Gemini integration required:
   - New client wrapper (`src/models/gemini_client.py`)
   - Model selection option (`--model gemini`)
   - Prompt optimization for simpler, more direct instructions
   - Target description adjustment ("'debate' link" instead of "the link with text 'debate'")
