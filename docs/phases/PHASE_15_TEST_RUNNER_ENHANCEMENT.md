# Phase 15 â€” Test Runner Agent Enhancement

## Overview
Enhance the Test Runner Agent to properly orchestrate test execution, manage test reporting as a living document, handle bug reporting, and make intelligent decisions about test flow based on failures.

**ETA**: 3 days

## Status: ðŸ“… PLANNED

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Development Strategy ðŸš¨
**NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY REQUIRED**
- This is an actively developed tool with no production users
- We will REPLACE old code completely - no gradual migrations
- No need for dual implementations or compatibility layers
- Development will happen on `agent-refinement` branch
- Each phase will PR against `agent-refinement`, not `main`
- If things go wrong, we'll abandon the branch and start over

## Motivation
The Test Runner Agent currently executes test steps literally without understanding intent or context. It needs to be enhanced to:
- Understand test objectives and step intent
- Break down high-level steps into actionable tasks
- Make intelligent decisions about test continuation
- Maintain comprehensive test reports throughout execution

## Current State
- Executes test steps literally
- Limited understanding of step intent
- No dynamic action injection
- Basic pass/fail reporting
- Cannot determine if failures are blockers

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Implement living test report generation and maintenance
2. Add intelligent step interpretation and action decomposition
3. Implement bug report generation for failures
4. Add blocker detection and test flow control
5. Enable dynamic helper action injection (scroll, wait, retry)

### Test Runner Workflow
```
1. Initialize Test Report
2. For each Test Case:
   a. Understand test case objective
   b. For each Step:
      i. Interpret step intent
      ii. Decompose into actions
      iii. Execute actions sequentially
      iv. Validate results
      v. Update report
   c. Handle failures intelligently
   d. Determine if can continue
3. Finalize Test Report
```

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Report Management
- [ ] Create TestReport data model
- [ ] Implement living document updates
- [ ] Add bug report generation logic
- [ ] Create report templates and formatting

### 2. Step Intelligence
- [ ] Enhance step interpretation logic
- [ ] Implement action decomposition
- [ ] Add context awareness for steps
- [ ] Create action sequencing logic

### 3. Action Orchestration
- [ ] Implement sequential action execution
- [ ] Enable helper action injection through AI interpretation

### 4. Failure Handling
- [ ] Implement failure classification (blocker vs non-blocker)
- [ ] Create test flow decision logic
- [ ] Implement cascade failure handling

### 5. Agent Communication
- [ ] Enhance Action Agent integration
- [ ] Improve error information gathering
- [ ] Implement status tracking

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for new components
- [ ] Integration tests with Action Agent
- [ ] Failure scenario testing
- [ ] End-to-end workflow validation

## Success Criteria
- Test reports are comprehensive and updated in real-time
- Steps are intelligently decomposed into actions
- Failures generate detailed bug reports
- Blocker failures stop execution appropriately
- Test flow decisions are logical and traceable

## Technical Details

### Test Report Structure
```python
@dataclass
class TestReport:
    test_plan_id: str
    started_at: datetime
    status: TestStatus
    test_cases: List[TestCaseResult]
    summary: TestSummary
    bugs: List[BugReport]
    
@dataclass
class TestCaseResult:
    test_case_id: str
    name: str
    status: TestStatus
    steps: List[StepResult]
    error: Optional[str]
    
@dataclass
class BugReport:
    step_id: str
    description: str
    severity: Severity
    screenshot: Optional[str]
    actual_result: str
    expected_result: str
    reproduction_steps: List[str]
```

### Action Decomposition Example
```
Step: "Add product to cart and verify count"
Decomposed Actions:
1. Locate "Add to Cart" button
2. Click button
3. Wait for cart update
4. Locate cart counter
5. Verify counter shows "1"
6. (If needed) Scroll to cart if not visible
```

### Failure Decision Matrix
| Failure Type | Step Critical | Test Case Action | Test Plan Action |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| UI Element Not Found | Yes | Stop Test Case | Continue |
| Assertion Failed | Yes | Stop Test Case | Continue |
| Navigation Failed | Yes | Stop Test Case | Stop if dependency |
| Timeout | No | Continue | Continue |
| Minor UI Issue | No | Continue | Continue |

## Dependencies
- Phase 14: Test Planner refinement (for structured input)
- Action Agent (for action execution)
- Existing Test Runner implementation

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Over-complex action decomposition
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple patterns, iterate based on results
- **Risk**: Incorrect blocker determination
  - **Mitigation**: Conservative approach, clear severity guidelines
- **Risk**: Performance impact from intelligence layer
  - **Mitigation**: Efficient caching, minimal API calls

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning for action patterns
- Historical failure analysis
- Parallel test case execution
- Smart test prioritization
- Self-healing test capabilities
