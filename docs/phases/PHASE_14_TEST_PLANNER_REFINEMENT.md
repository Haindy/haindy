# Phase 14 â€” Test Planner Agent Refinement

## Overview
Refine the Test Planner Agent to create well-structured test plans with clear hierarchy and both machine-readable (JSON) and human-readable (Markdown) outputs.

**ETA**: 2 days

## Status: ðŸ“… PLANNED

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Development Strategy ðŸš¨
**NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY REQUIRED**
- This is an actively developed tool with no production users
- We will REPLACE old code completely - no gradual migrations
- No need for dual implementations or compatibility layers
- Development will happen on `agent-refinement` branch
- Each phase will PR against `agent-refinement`, not `main`
- If things go wrong, we'll abandon the branch and start over

## Motivation
The Test Planner Agent needs clearer responsibilities and better structured outputs. It should create comprehensive test plans that contain test cases, which in turn contain steps, following a clear hierarchical structure.

## Current State
- Test Planner creates simple JSON test plans
- Limited structure in test plan outputs
- No human-readable format generation
- Unclear separation between test plan, test cases, and steps

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Implement clear test plan hierarchy: Test Plan â†’ Test Cases â†’ Steps
2. Generate both JSON (for machine processing) and Markdown (for human readability) outputs
3. Enhance requirement analysis and interpretation capabilities
4. Improve test coverage determination logic

### Test Plan Structure
```
Test Plan
â”œâ”€â”€ Metadata (name, description, requirements source, created date)
â”œâ”€â”€ Test Case 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Name
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Description
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Prerequisites
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Step 1 (action, expected result)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Step 2 (action, expected result)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Step N (action, expected result)
â””â”€â”€ Test Case N
```

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Data Model Enhancement
- [ ] Create TestPlan dataclass with metadata
- [ ] Create TestCase dataclass with proper fields
- [ ] Update TestStep model if needed
- [ ] Add validation for hierarchical structure

### 2. Test Planner Agent Updates
- [ ] Update system prompt for hierarchical understanding
- [ ] Implement structured output generation
- [ ] Add logic for test case prioritization
- [ ] Enhance requirement parsing capabilities

### 3. Output Generation
- [ ] Implement JSON serialization for test plans
- [ ] Create Markdown formatter for human-readable output
- [ ] Add template system for consistent formatting
- [ ] Ensure bidirectional conversion (JSON â†” Markdown)

### 4. Integration Updates
- [ ] Update interfaces to support new data model
- [ ] Modify coordinator to handle hierarchical plans
- [ ] Update test runner to consume new format
- [ ] Clean replacement of existing code

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for new data models
- [ ] Test planner output validation
- [ ] Integration tests with test runner
- [ ] End-to-end test with sample requirements

## Success Criteria
- Test plans have clear three-level hierarchy
- Both JSON and Markdown outputs are generated
- Human-readable plans are easily understandable
- Test Runner can consume and execute new format
- Existing tests continue to pass

## Technical Details

### Sample JSON Structure
```json
{
  "test_plan": {
    "name": "E-commerce Checkout Flow",
    "description": "Comprehensive test plan for checkout process",
    "created_at": "2025-01-10T10:00:00Z",
    "requirements_source": "PRD v1.2",
    "test_cases": [
      {
        "id": "TC001",
        "name": "Guest Checkout",
        "description": "Verify guest users can complete checkout",
        "priority": "Critical",
        "prerequisites": ["Product catalog available", "Payment gateway active"],
        "steps": [
          {
            "step_number": 1,
            "action": "Navigate to product page",
            "expected_result": "Product page loads with details"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Sample Markdown Output
```markdown
# Test Plan: E-commerce Checkout Flow

**Description**: Comprehensive test plan for checkout process  
**Created**: 2025-01-10  
**Requirements**: PRD v1.2  

## Test Case TC001: Guest Checkout

**Priority**: Critical  
**Description**: Verify guest users can complete checkout  

### Prerequisites
- Product catalog available
- Payment gateway active

### Test Steps
1. **Navigate to product page**  
   _Expected_: Product page loads with details
```

## Dependencies
- Existing Test Planner Agent implementation
- Core data models
- Test Runner Agent (for consumption)

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Breaking existing test execution
  - **Mitigation**: Complete replacement on separate branch, thorough testing before merge
- **Risk**: Overly complex test plans
  - **Mitigation**: Clear guidelines and examples in prompts

## Future Enhancements
- Test plan versioning
- Test case dependencies
- Conditional test execution
- Test data management
