# Phase 12 â€” Test Scenarios

## Overview
Create 5 comprehensive test scenarios, measure success rates.

**ETA**: 2-3 days

## Status: ðŸ”„ In Progress

### Current State
- Created 5 comprehensive test scenarios
- Wikipedia search scenario demonstrates all action types
- Known limitation: GPT-4o-mini vision capabilities with multiple images
- **Progress**: 1/5 scenarios working

### Tasks
1. Create 5 comprehensive test scenarios covering different testing needs
2. Ensure scenarios demonstrate all system capabilities
3. Measure and document success rates
4. Document scenario creation best practices

### Test Scenarios Created
1. **Wikipedia Search** - Tests navigation, search, scrolling, and content verification
2. **E-commerce Checkout** - Tests product browsing, cart management, and checkout flow
3. **Form Submission** - Tests complex form interactions and validation
4. **Multi-tab Navigation** - Tests tab management and cross-tab workflows
5. **Authentication Flow** - Tests login, session management, and logout

### Remaining Work
- Test remaining 4 scenarios (beyond Wikipedia)
- Document scenario creation best practices
- Create scenario templates for common use cases
- Measure and report success rates

### Known Issues
- GPT-4o-mini has limitations with multiple image analysis
- Typing validation issues have been resolved with GPT-5 (vision-enabled configuration)
- Complex scenarios may require conversation-based AI interactions (Phase 13)

### Success Criteria
- At least 3 out of 5 scenarios execute successfully end-to-end
- Each scenario demonstrates different system capabilities
- Clear documentation on creating new test scenarios
- Performance metrics collected for each scenario
