# Phase 10 — Security & Monitoring

**Status**: Completed

**ETA**: 2 days

## Tasks

- Rate limiting
- Logging
- Analytics
- Execution reporting

## Implementation Details

### 4.6 Security & Safety

**Rate limiting**: Coordinated API throttling across all agents
- Per-agent rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion
- Global rate limiter shared across all agent instances
- Configurable limits per minute/hour/day
- Graceful degradation when limits approached

**Sensitive data protection**: PII detection before screenshot sharing
- Screenshot sanitization for passwords and credit card fields
- Configurable sensitive data patterns
- Automatic masking in logs and reports
- Compliance with data protection regulations

**Sandboxed execution**: Browser isolation, controlled navigation scope
- Restricted navigation to allowed domains only
- Prevention of file downloads without explicit permission
- Isolation from local file system access
- Network request monitoring and filtering

### 4.7 Observability & Debugging

**Multi-agent logging**: Track communication between agents
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Agent-to-agent message tracking
- Performance metrics per agent operation
- Debug mode with verbose output

**Test execution reports**: Complete workflow documentation
- Step-by-step execution timeline
- Success/failure status per step
- Screenshot evidence collection
- Action replay capabilities

**Agent performance metrics**: Individual agent success rates
- Response time tracking per agent
- Success rate by agent and action type
- Resource usage monitoring
- Bottleneck identification

**Visual evidence**: Screenshot captures at each decision point
- Before/after screenshots for each action
- Grid overlay visualization in debug mode
- Failure screenshot capturing
- Historical screenshot comparison

**Execution timeline**: Full audit trail with timestamps and decisions
- Millisecond-precision timing
- Decision reasoning capture
- Alternative paths considered
- Complete reproducibility
