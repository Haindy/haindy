# Phase 0: Prep - Repository Scaffold and Project Structure

## Phase Overview

**Tasks**: Repo scaffold, `pre-commit`, multi-agent project structure.

**ETA**: 1 day

**Status**: Completed

## Objectives

This foundational phase establishes the repository structure and development environment for the HAINDY autonomous AI testing agent. It sets up the core infrastructure needed for multi-agent architecture development.

## Key Deliverables

1. **Repository Initialization**
   - Git repository setup with proper `.gitignore`
   - Branch protection and development workflow established
   - Initial commit structure

2. **Development Environment**
   - Python 3.10+ virtual environment configuration
   - Core dependencies specification
   - Development tools setup

3. **Pre-commit Configuration**
   - Code formatting (Black, isort)
   - Linting (flake8, mypy)
   - Security checks
   - Automated quality gates

4. **Multi-Agent Project Structure**
   - Comprehensive folder hierarchy as defined in the plan:
     - `src/agents/` - AI agent implementations
     - `src/orchestration/` - Multi-agent coordination
     - `src/browser/` - Browser automation layer
     - `src/grid/` - Adaptive grid system
     - `src/models/` - AI model interfaces
     - `src/core/` - Abstraction layers
     - `src/error_handling/` - Recovery mechanisms
     - `src/security/` - Safety measures
     - `src/monitoring/` - Logging and analytics
     - `src/config/` - Configuration management
   - Test structure (`tests/`)
   - Documentation structure (`docs/`)
   - Data directories (`data/`, `reports/`, `test_scenarios/`)

5. **Package Configuration**
   - `pyproject.toml` setup with project metadata
   - Dependencies management
   - Entry points definition

## Technical Details

### Pre-commit Hooks Configuration
- Black for code formatting
- isort for import sorting
- flake8 for style guide enforcement
- mypy for type checking
- Security vulnerability scanning

### Project Metadata
- Package name: `autonomous-ai-testing-agent`
- Initial version: 0.0.1
- Python requirement: >=3.10
- License: To be determined based on project requirements

## Success Criteria

- Repository properly initialized with Git
- All directory structures created according to plan
- Pre-commit hooks installed and functional
- Development environment reproducible
- Initial documentation in place

## Lessons Learned

- Establishing a clear folder structure early prevents refactoring later
- Pre-commit hooks ensure consistent code quality from the start
- Multi-agent architecture requires careful separation of concerns in the project structure
