# Phase 9 â€” Error Handling & Recovery

**Status**: Completed

**ETA**: 2 days

## Tasks

- Agent-level error handling
- Retry logic
- Fallback strategies

## Implementation Details

### 4.4 Error Handling & Recovery

**Agent-level error handling**: Each agent validates its own outputs
- Action Agent: Validates grid coordinates are within bounds
- Evaluator Agent: Validates confidence scores are reasonable (0-1 range)
- Test Runner: Validates test state consistency
- Test Planner: Validates test plan structure and completeness

**Cross-agent validation**: Results validated by subsequent agents
- Action Agent results validated by browser execution success
- Browser results validated by Evaluator Agent
- Evaluator results validated by Test Runner state management

**Retry logic**: Max 3 attempts per action with agent coordination
- Exponential backoff between retries (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Different strategy on each retry (e.g., different grid resolution)
- Coordination with Test Runner to decide retry vs. skip

**Fallback strategies**: Alternative action paths when primary approaches fail
- Grid refinement for ambiguous targets
- Alternative action types (e.g., keyboard navigation if click fails)
- Graceful degradation with detailed failure reporting

## Hierarchical Agent Validation Strategy

### 8.1 Layered Validation Architecture

**Bottom-Up Validation**:
- Action-level agents return results with confidence scores
- Each agent validates its own output before passing upstream
- Confidence thresholds trigger retry or escalation

**Top-Down Confirmation**:
- Higher-level agents (Test Runner, Planner) verify lower-level outputs
- Contextual consistency checks across agent decisions
- Cross-agent validation prevents cascading errors

### 8.2 Confidence Threshold System

| Confidence Level | Action Taken | Escalation |
|------------------|--------------|------------|
| 95-100% | Execute immediately | None |
| 80-94% | Execute with monitoring | Log for review |
| 60-79% | Trigger adaptive refinement | Retry with refinement |
| 40-59% | Request human guidance | Pause for intervention |
| 0-39% | Fail gracefully | Escalate to human |

### 8.3 Hallucination Mitigation

**Cross-Agent Verification**:
- Action Agent decisions validated by Evaluator Agent
- Test Runner Agent maintains execution context consistency
- Planner Agent validates step sequence logical flow

**Confidence Scoring**:
- Multi-factor confidence calculation (visual clarity, context match, historical success)
- Confidence degradation triggers additional validation layers
- Human-in-the-loop triggers for persistent low confidence

**Validation Checkpoints**:
- Pre-action validation: "Is this action appropriate for current context?"
- Post-action validation: "Did the action achieve expected outcome?"
- Sequence validation: "Does current state align with test plan progression?"

## Key Achievements

- Implemented comprehensive error handling across all agents
- Built retry logic with exponential backoff
- Created fallback strategies for common failure scenarios
- Established confidence threshold system for decision making
- Implemented cross-agent validation to prevent error cascades
